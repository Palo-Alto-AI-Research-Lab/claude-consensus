r"""fleet_sign.py - machine identity and detached signatures for a multi-machine agent fleet.

THE PROBLEM
  Our ledger recorded WHO decided something as a string: `actor` inside the event, and a machine
  name inside the shard filename. Both are written by whoever has write access to the shared
  folder. So the honest answer to "which machine committed this" was "whoever claimed to". For a
  human-in-the-loop gate that is not good enough: the gate's whole value is that a Tier-2 commit
  carries a recorded human approval, and an unauthenticated ledger cannot tell you that the
  approval line was not simply typed in.

THE CHOICE: reuse, don't build
  Ed25519 detached signatures via OpenSSH's `ssh-keygen -Y sign|verify`. No crypto library, no
  key format of our own, no C dependency, present on every machine we run. Two external research
  passes both landed on the same answer: signing a canonical JSON body with tooling that already
  ships with the OS beats every alternative for a fleet this size.

LAYOUT (each choice closes an incident class we actually hit)
  * PRIVATE key   local app-data, per machine, NEVER synced. Syncing identity is what produced
                  our duplicate-session incidents; a machine's identity must be as unsyncable
                  as its serial number.
  * PUBLIC keys   <bus>/_engine/signers/<MACHINE>.pub - ONE FILE PER MACHINE, single writer.
                  Same forever-fix as the mailboxes: no shared multi-writer file, no conflicts.
  * REVOCATION    <bus>/_engine/signers/REVOKED.txt, one principal per line.
  * allowed_signers is ASSEMBLED IN MEMORY at every verify from signers/*.pub minus REVOKED.
                  There is deliberately no shared allowed_signers file to fight over or go stale.
  * namespace     "fleet", so these signatures are meaningless outside this system.

ROLLOUT ORDER (do not skip)
  sign everything and verify nothing (dark) -> a readable audit command -> only then set an
  enforcement timestamp, forward in time. Flip straight to enforcement and you quarantine every
  machine that has not rolled out a key yet, which on day one is all of them.
  The enforcement decision itself lives in protocol_guards.py (`sig_enforced`).

  python fleet_sign.py init | pub | audit | selftest

API: sign_event(ev) -> armored signature | None      verify_event(ev) -> True | False | None
     None means "unsigned, or no registry/tooling here" - a rollout gap, NOT a tampering signal.
     Keeping those two apart is the difference between a signature layer and a slogan.

    SCAR (cost us a day): a Windows machine can easily have TWO ssh-keygen.exe on PATH, the one
    bundled in System32\OpenSSH and the one shipped with Git for Windows. On our box the bundled
    build HANGS for 30 seconds with no output and no error on `-Y sign` fed through stdin, which
    is exactly how the functions below call it. Worse, Windows' executable search can resolve a
    bare "ssh-keygen" to either build depending on the calling context - interactive shell vs raw
    subprocess vs scheduled task - so which one you get is not reliably the working one. The
    symptom was maddening: freshly signed events verified BAD in the audit while this file's own
    selftest passed, because the two ran under different contexts.

    So: pin to a known-good binary, allow an override, and fall back to a PATH lookup only where
    there is exactly one - never silently regress to the broken build.
