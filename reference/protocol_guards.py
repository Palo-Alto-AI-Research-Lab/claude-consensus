r"""protocol_guards.py - the four guards that grew around the consensus core.

`consensus.py` is the negotiation: propose -> counter -> accept -> commit. It shipped first
because it is the part people ask for. Then we ran it across six machines for a month, and
four separate things bit us. Each fix is a small deterministic guard that wraps the core
without changing the protocol, and each is here as a pure function with a selftest:

  1. ARBITER ELECTION      the tie-break role was pinned to one named machine. That machine
                           dying wedged every tier-0 proposal in the fleet, silently.
  2. PROOF GRADING         "verified" was a free-text field, so "looks fine to me" counted as
                           evidence and a task went green on a sentence.
  3. RISK TRACKING         risk was one integer chosen by the proposing agent. A sensitive
                           action carried at a low tier walked straight past the human gate.
  4. SIGNATURE AUDIT       "who said this" was a machine name inside a filename. Anything
                           able to write to the shared folder could be any machine.

None of these is exotic. All four are the same shape: something the protocol TRUSTED without
CHECKING. If you run agents across machines you will meet all four, roughly in this order.

    python protocol_guards.py selftest

Sanitized from the live implementation: machine names, chat ids and paths are placeholders,
the reasoning in the comments is verbatim.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. ARBITER ELECTION - the tie-break role must survive its own holder dying
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The original design named one leader in config and gave it the tie-break function (resolve a
# tier-0 proposal whose round cap or timeout expired). Single-writer, deterministic, fine - until
# the leader is the machine that dies. Then nothing re-assigns the role: tier-0 proposals sit
# unresolved and NOBODY IS ALERTED, because every remaining peer is behaving correctly.
#
# The fix reuses the presence lease the fleet already writes (a per-machine heartbeat file whose
# mtime is the only signal) - no new heartbeat, no new state to keep in sync:
#
#   * every ticking peer computes the arbiter the SAME way from the SAME ordered list, so all
#     peers agree on who arbitrates this tick without exchanging a single message;
#   * a machine is eligible only on POSITIVE evidence of being alive (fresh stamp). An ABSENT
#     stamp does not promote anybody - fail-safe, because "no evidence" is not "dead";
#   * ME is always eligible (I am running, therefore I am awake);
#   * a travelling laptop at the head of the list never wedges the fleet: it is skipped to the
#     next live machine and reclaims the role when its stamp goes fresh again.
#
# The ordered list is a human decision (whose machine should arbitrate first), so it lives in
# config, not in code. Ours is: always-on hub, then the anchor VPS, then laptops.

# like "checked, works" and the task went green. A claim is not evidence. So a proof is graded
# `proven` only if it carries a pattern that a machine could not have written without actually
# running something: a zero exit code, a hash, a counter that moved, a before/after pair.
#
# This is not a language check, it is a check for the RESIDUE of an action. An agent that wants
# to fake it now has to fabricate a specific number, which is a much brighter line to cross and
# a much easier lie to catch.
#
# Grading is armed from a timestamp, so every event recorded before you turned it on is
# grandfathered. Retroactive standards invalidate honest history and nobody trusts the ledger
# after that.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. RISK TRACKING - one integer chosen by the proposer is not a risk model
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The human gate fires on tier >= 2, and the tier is set by the agent making the proposal. That
# is the weakest link in the whole design, and we already guard it with a keyword tripwire that
# force-bumps obvious cases (see consensus.py `_tripwire_hit`).
#
# The tripwire catches dangerous WORDS. It does not catch a dangerous CATEGORY carried at a low
# tier: "update the outreach template" is tier-0 by any reasonable reading and still ends with
# text going to strangers. So we classify a proposal into a track as well, independently of the
# tier the proposer chose.
#
# Note how this ships: in SHADOW. It classifies, it logs, it changes nothing. Because the honest
# question is not "is a second signal nicer" but "does it catch anything the tier alone misses",
# and you can only answer that with a log. `would_benefit` is written to be FALSIFIABLE: it is
# False for anything already tier-2 (the engine escalates it anyway) and False for the general
# track. It is True only for the narrow case this guard exists for - a sensitive track carried
# at a low tier. If that stays at zero for a month, the guard is not needed and we delete it.
